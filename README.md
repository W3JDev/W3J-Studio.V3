## üéØ The Problem

In today's visually-driven world, high-quality images are no longer a luxury‚Äîthey're a necessity. For marketers, creators, and individuals, professional photo editing has traditionally been:
*   **Complex & Skill-Intensive:** Requiring mastery of complicated software like Photoshop.
*   **Time-Consuming:** Even simple edits can take hours of meticulous work.
*   **Expensive:** Hiring professional editors or subscribing to high-end software is costly.

This creates a significant barrier, preventing many from realizing the full potential of their visual content.

## ‚ú® The Solution: W3J Studio

W3J Studio is a web-based, AI-powered photo studio that democratizes professional-grade photo editing. By leveraging the advanced capabilities of the Google Gemini API, we transform complex, time-consuming tasks into simple, intuitive, one-click solutions. Our platform empowers anyone to create stunning, studio-quality visuals directly in their browser, no expertise required.

## üìñ User Guide: How to Use W3J Studio

Welcome! This guide will walk you through the main features of the app.

### 1. Getting Started: Upload Your Image
- To begin, simply **drag and drop** an image file onto the start screen or click the **"Upload Image"** button.
- The app works best with standard image formats like PNG, JPEG, and WEBP.

### 2. The Main Interface: Two Ways to Edit
Once your image is loaded, you'll see two main tabs at the bottom:
- **Studio Solutions (The Magic Wand):** This is for powerful, one-click results. Use this when you want the AI to perform a complex task for you automatically.
- **Pro Editor (The Artist's Toolbox):** This is for manual control. Use this for making specific adjustments, adding generative layers, and cropping.

### 3. Studio Solutions: Your Automated AI Studios

This panel organizes powerful tools into dedicated workflows.

#### **Portrait Studio**
Everything you need for editing photos of people.
- **One-Click Tools:** Use **"Auto Portrait Enhance"** for instant professional retouching, the **"AI Profile Designer"** to generate multiple profile pictures, or the **"Passport Photo"** tool to create a compliant ID photo.
- **Guided Retouching:** For targeted fixes, first **click on the face** in the image (e.g., on the skin, eyes, or hair). This tells the AI where to focus. Then, click a tool like **"Smooth Skin"** or **"Fix Flyaway Hair"** to apply the effect to that specific area.

#### **Scene Studio**
Tools for manipulating the background and environment.
- **Background Remover:** Instantly removes the background from your main subject.
- **Smart Background:** Generates four different, context-aware backgrounds for your subject.
- **Scene Creator:** Describe a new scene in the text box (e.g., "a futuristic city at night") to place your subject in a completely new environment.
- **Generative Uncrop:** Expands the canvas of your photo, letting the AI creatively fill in the missing areas.

#### **Product Studio**
Create professional shots for e-commerce and marketing.
- **Product Scenes:** Place your object into a pre-designed professional setting like a marble podium or a wooden table.
- **Shadows & Reflections:** Add realistic drop shadows or reflections to ground your object in its scene.

#### **General Tools**

- **Magic Recreate:** Rebuilds your entire photo from scratch to be ultra-sharp and clear.

### 4. Pro Editor: Fine-Tuned Manual Control

Switch to this tab for precision work.

#### **Generative Tab**
This is where you can add, modify, or remove things using layers.
- **Point & Prompt:** Select the **"Add Point"** tool, click anywhere on the image, and type a prompt (e.g., "a small blue butterfly") to generate a new element on its own layer.
- **Brush & Erase:** Select the **"Brush"** tool to paint over an area. Then, type a prompt to modify only that area. You can also use this to **"Remove"** an object. The **"Erase"** tool modifies your painted selection.
- **Smart Select:** Click on any object in your image to have the AI automatically create a perfect selection mask around it.

#### **Adjust Tab**
Apply global effects to your entire image.
- **Adjustments:** Apply complex lighting and color changes like "Blur Background" or "Warmer Lighting." You can also click on the image first to apply these effects to a localized area.
- **Sharpen, Filters, Effects:** Apply creative filters, visual effects like lens flares, or precisely sharpen your image.
- **Style Transfer:** Upload a second "style" image to transfer its artistic style to your photo.

## üöÄ Getting Started & Deployment Guide

This project is already configured for secure deployment on Vercel. Your Gemini API key is protected by a serverless function that prevents it from ever being exposed in the browser.

### Prerequisites
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later) & npm
*   [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) (for local development)
*   A **Google Gemini API Key**. Get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
*   A [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account.

### Local Development (The Secure Way)

Because this project uses a secure API proxy, you must use the Vercel CLI to run it locally. This accurately simulates the production environment and makes your API proxy available to the frontend.

1.  **Clone & Install:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/w3j-studio.git
    cd w3j-studio
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Set up environment file for local use:**
    Create a file named `.env.local`:
    ```bash
    touch .env.local
    ```
    Open `.env.local` and add your key:
    ```
    API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
    ```

3.  **Run with Vercel CLI:**
    ```bash
    vercel dev
    ```
    The app and the API proxy will now be running, typically on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Deploying to Vercel (Live Version for Judges)

1.  **Push to GitHub:** Create a new repository on GitHub and push your project code.

2.  **Import to Vercel:**
    - Go to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/) and click **"Add New... -> Project"**.
